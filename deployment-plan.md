# Deployment Plan for DoozerExcelAddIn Web App

## Step 1: Analyze the Project
1. **Project Structure**:
   - The project appears to be a Node.js application based on the presence of `package.json` and `server.js`.
   - The `webpack.config.js` suggests that the project uses Webpack for bundling assets.
   - The `src/` directory contains the main application code, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the taskpane and commands.

2. **Azure App Service Configuration**:
   - Runtime Stack: Node.js (22-LTS).
   - Operating System: Linux.
   - App Service Plan: PremiumV3 (P1v3).
   - Deployment logs indicate a failed deployment attempt.

3. **Deployment Artifacts**:
   - Two ZIP files (`deploy.zip` and `deploy-complete.zip`) are present, which might be related to previous deployment attempts.

---

## Step 2: Prepare the Application for Deployment
1. **Verify Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all dependencies listed in `package.json` are installed and compatible with Node.js 22-LTS.
   - Run `npm install` locally to confirm there are no missing or incompatible packages.

2. **Build the Application**:
   - If the project requires bundling (e.g., Webpack), run the build command (`npm run build` or equivalent) to generate production-ready assets in the `dist/` directory.

3. **Check Configuration Files**:
   - Review `.deployment` for deployment-specific settings.
   - Ensure `babel.config.json` and `webpack.config.js` are correctly configured for production.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Define any required environment variables in Azure App Service under "Configuration > Application Settings."

---

## Step 3: Package the Application
1. **Create a Deployment Package**:
   - Package the necessary files (e.g., `dist/`, `server.js`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`) into a ZIP file.
   - Exclude unnecessary files like `node_modules` (if using Azure's built-in package installation) and development files.

2. **Validate the Package**:
   - Test the ZIP package locally to ensure it contains all required files for deployment.

---

## Step 4: Deploy to Azure App Service
1. **Deployment Methods**:
   - Use one of the following methods to deploy the application:
     - **Azure CLI**:
       - Run `az webapp deploy` with the ZIP package.
     - **Git Deployment**:
       - Push the code to Azure's Git repository.
     - **Deployment Center**:
       - Upload the ZIP package directly via the Azure portal.

2. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Check deployment logs in the Azure portal for errors or warnings.
   - Ensure the application starts successfully.

---

## Step 5: Post-Deployment Configuration
1. **Verify Application Settings**:
   - Ensure environment variables are correctly set.
   - Configure custom domains if required.

2. **Enable Monitoring**:
   - Set up Application Insights for performance monitoring and error tracking.

3. **Test the Application**:
   - Access the application via the default domain (`doozeraiexceladdin-hypcdsaba8d3dwbn.westus2-01.azurewebsites.net`) and verify functionality.

4. **Scale and Optimize**:
   - Adjust the App Service Plan if needed to handle traffic and performance requirements.
